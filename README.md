A confusion matrix is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of a classification model. It provides a summary of prediction results on a classification problem, giving insight into how many instances were correctly or incorrectly classified by the model.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to create and display a confusion matrix in Python using a sample dataset:

Load a dataset.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a classifier.
Make predictions.
Generate and display the confusion matrix.
